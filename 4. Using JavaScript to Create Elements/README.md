In this lesson, we'll move the creation of the grid elements into JavaScript. This is because it is easier to generate more grid squares this way, without needing to be so repetitive.

We'll also add a wall, or a grid square that the player cannot move into.

Consider what you've learned so far, along with the code comments that explain what is happening and contain supplemental links to documentation.
